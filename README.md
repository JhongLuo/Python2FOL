# Python2FOL
Compile the user-provided Python program into a first-order logic sentence with addition and multiplication. The sentence is true if and only if the Python program halts

Three facts can be used to demonstrate GÃ¶del's first incompleteness theorem. First, programs can obtain its own code (without external assistance). Second, a Turing machine can be encoded into a first-order logic sentence. Third, there is an algorithm to search for proofs of first-order logic sentences (proofs are recognizable). This repository is a small demonstration of the second fact.
